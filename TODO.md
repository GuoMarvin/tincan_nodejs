# What needs to be done

## Database

* Need connectors for at least one data store.

## Test Cases

* The test cases are ugly and difficult to read. There may
be node modules that we can use for the fixtures and http
client helpers.

## Statement Object (Spec 4.0)

### Statement ID (Spec 4.1.1)

* MUST be generated by the LRS if a statement
is received without an ID.

## Runtime Communication (Spec 6.0)

### Runtime Encoding (Spec 6.2)

* MUST include the "X-Experience-API Version" header in
every response;

* MUST set this header to "1.0";

* MUST reject requests with version header prior to "1.0"
unless such requests are routed to a fully conformant
implementation of the prior version specified in the header;

* MUST make these rejects by responding with an HTTP 400 error
including a short description of the problem.
